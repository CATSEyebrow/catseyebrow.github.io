Please contact me if you want to know me.
But a few things to note:
* I'm 27.
* I graduated from Tohoku University and earned a master's degree in space robotics.
* My professional interest is Mathematics, especially statistics.
  * Data science in the manufacturing industry.
* Studying languages is one of my lifelong hobbies.
  * English: decent, I think.
  * French: Bonjour! level.
* Analyzing movies is also one of my lifelong hobbies.
  * Too long to write here.
* I abhor all forms of dishonesty.

And a few of my favorite words:
